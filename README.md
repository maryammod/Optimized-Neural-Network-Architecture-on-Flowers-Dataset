# Optimized-Artificial-Neural-Network-Architecture-on-Flowers-Dataset

The Artificial Neural Network is the computer model inspired by the
structure of the Human Brain. It views as in the set of artificial nerve cells that are
interconnected with the other neurons. The primary aim of this project is to
demonstrate the process of developing Artificial Neural Networks based classifiers
using the Iris flower database. The problem concerns the identification of Iris plant
species on the basis of plant attribute measurements. Neural networks are
implemented towards the identification of Iris plants on the basis of the following
measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Different ANN architecture used to find the best-fit for the dataset . The
accuracy of %100 is achieved by setting the optimum value of hyperparameters using cross validation method.
